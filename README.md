hello this is my robotic projects that are coded using c++
The hardware that are used are like the 
- arduino uno,
- raspberry pi pico,
- jumper wires (male to male, male to female, female to female),
- sensors like a ultrasonic sensor,IR sensor, sound sensor and more, water sensor,
- bredboard,
- a relay modual
- LED
- resistors
- LCD moduelm (16 pins or 4 pins),
- USB cable
- moters like a servo motor and stepper motor

Project 1: blink a LED 
- it is used to blink a LED using the code only

Project 2: blink differnt color LEDs
- it is used to blink differnt color LEDs in differnt times

project 3: ir_sensor_working_a_relay
- it is used to send a signal to a relay to connect what is connected to it

project 4: chrom_dinasor_game
- it it used with LCD screan and a push batton to make the chrom_dinasor_game 

project 5: joystick_moving_servo_motors
- it used to make a sarvo motor to move in the dirction of the joystick
